## Deliverable 1 - Digital Product and Promotional Website 

- [Finished Icon Set](http://martinemcgrath.github.io/ixd304-icons/images/icon-set.png) - Without sounding like an alcoholic, for my digital product I wanted to focus on something I like and would enjoy creating. I decided to create a set of classic cocktail icons. For my icons I wanted to take a detailed and fun illustrated style, focusing on bold colours, gradients, highlights and depth. 

- [Promotional Website](http://martinemcgrath.github.io/ixd304-icons/index.html) - For my promotional website I wanted to design a website that would promote and advertise my icons, whilst also fitting in with the visual approach taken for my icon style. Therefore I made my site colourful and included a description and ingredients for each cocktail icon to make my site resemble a drinks menu.
